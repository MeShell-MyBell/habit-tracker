## Agile Development

I used an agile approach to build this project, which means I broke the work down into small, manageable tasks. This helped me stay organized and make steady progress on the habit tracker.

**ðŸ”— [View my Project Board](https://github.com/MeShell-MyBell/habit-tracker/projects)**

I organized my work using GitHub's project board, which is like a digital to-do list. I moved tasks through different stages:
- **Backlog**: Ideas and features I might add later
- **To Do**: Tasks ready to work on next  
- **In Progress**: What I'm currently building
- **Done**: Completed features

I divided the project into three main phases:

**Phase 1 - Getting Started**
- Set up the basic Django project
- Created user login and registration
- Built the main habit features (add, view, edit, delete)
- Got the app working on Heroku

**Phase 2 - Adding Features**
- Added categories to organize habits
- Built the progress tracking system
- Made the app look good with Bootstrap
- Fixed bugs and improved forms

**Phase 3 - Final Touches**
- Added password reset feature
- Polished the design and user experience
- Set up the admin area
- Tested everything thoroughly

I used the MoSCoW method to decide what was most important:
- **Must Have**: Essential features needed for the app to work
- **Should Have**: Important features that make the app better
- **Could Have**: Nice extras if I had time

This approach helped me focus on building a working app first, then adding improvements. It also meant I always had something functional to show, even if all features weren't complete yet.

## UX Design

### User Stories
I used an agile workflow for the project. First I created user stories to set up small, achievable and precise tasks. The MoSCoW system was helpful for me to focus on getting an MVP created by focusing on getting the must-haves done.

Here are the user stories:

**Must Have:**
- As a site user, I want to register and log in so that only I can access my habits.
- As a site user, I want to create habits in different categories so that I can organize my goals.
- As a site user, I want to mark habits as complete so that I can track my daily progress.
- As a site user, I want to view my habits so that I can see what I need to accomplish.

**Should Have:**
- As a site user, I want to edit my habits so that I can update my goals as they evolve.
- As a site user, I want to delete habits so that I can remove goals I no longer want to pursue.
- As a site user, I want to see my progress over time so that I can stay motivated.

**Could Have:**
- As a site user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it.
- As a site user, I want to categorize my habits so that I can organize them by type.

## AI Implementation

This section documents how AI tools were used during the development of this habit tracker application.

### AI-Assisted Development Process

During the development of this habit tracker, I used GitHub Copilot and other AI tools to enhance productivity and code quality:

#### Code Generation and Completion
- **Django Models**: AI assisted in generating the initial model structures for Habit, Category, and Progress models
- **Form Creation**: Auto-completion helped create comprehensive Django forms with proper validation
- **Template Structure**: AI suggestions provided Bootstrap-compatible HTML template layouts

#### Problem Solving and Debugging
- **Error Resolution**: When encountering Django-specific errors, AI tools provided contextual solutions
- **Best Practices**: AI suggestions helped implement Django security best practices and proper authentication flows
- **Code Optimization**: Received suggestions for more efficient database queries and view structures

#### Documentation and Comments
- **Code Comments**: AI assisted in writing clear, descriptive comments for complex functions
- **README Content**: AI tools helped structure and improve the documentation you're reading now
- **User Story Refinement**: AI feedback helped refine user stories to be more specific and testable

### AI Tools Used

1. **GitHub Copilot**: Primary coding assistant for:
   - Auto-completing Django view functions
   - Generating form validation logic
   - Creating template structures
   - Writing test cases

2. **Claude/ChatGPT**: Used for:
   - Planning project architecture
   - Debugging complex issues
   - Refining documentation
   - Code review and suggestions

3. **AI-Powered Code Analysis**: For:
   - Identifying potential security vulnerabilities
   - Suggesting performance improvements
   - Code style and PEP8 compliance checking

### Human Oversight and Validation

While AI tools were valuable throughout development, all AI-generated code was:
- **Manually Reviewed**: Every suggestion was carefully evaluated before implementation
- **Tested Thoroughly**: All AI-assisted code went through the same testing process
- **Customized**: AI suggestions were adapted to fit the specific needs of this project
- **Validated**: Functionality was verified to meet user requirements and project goals

### Learning Outcomes

Using AI tools during development provided valuable learning experiences:
- **Faster Development**: Reduced time spent on boilerplate code
- **Best Practices**: Learned Django patterns and conventions through AI suggestions
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Improved ability to debug and optimize code with AI assistance
- **Code Quality**: Enhanced code readability and maintainability

This project demonstrates how AI can be effectively used as a development tool while maintaining human oversight and decision-making in the creative and architectural aspects of software development.
